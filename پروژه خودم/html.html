<p >The <b> Solar System</b> is a collection of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects like asteroids and comets. Everything orbits the Sun due to its strong gravity. The planets vary in size and composition-inner planets are rocky, while outer planets are gas or ice giants. The Solar System formed about <b>4.6 billion</b> years ago from a cloud of gas and dust.

<div class="gen" style="margin-top: 160px; margin-right: 50px; "> <p style=" font-size: 23px;">The Sun is a star at the center of our solar system. It is a huge ball of hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium, and it produces energy through a process called nuclear fusion. In this process, hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing a large amount of heat and light.

The Sun provides light and heat that make life on Earth possible. It controls the motion of planets and other objects in the solar system with its strong gravity. Sunlight also helps plants grow through photosynthesis.

The surface of the Sun is very hot (about 5,500°C), and its core is even hotter (about 15 million°C). Sometimes, dark spots called sunspots appear on its surface, which are cooler areas with strong magnetic activity.

Without the Sun, Earth would be cold and dark, and life as we know it would not exist.</p></div>

<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet where life exists. It has a rich variety of environments, including oceans, mountains, forests, and deserts. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered with water, which helps regulate the planet’s temperature and supports all forms of life.

Earth’s atmosphere is made of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are essential for breathing and protecting living organisms from harmful radiation from the Sun. The planet has a natural satellite called the Moon, which affects ocean tides and helps stabilize Earth’s rotation.

Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating day and night, and orbits the Sun in about 365 days, forming one year. With its balanced climate and abundant resources, Earth remains a unique and beautiful planet in our solar system.</p>

<div class="pens"><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the Red Planet because of its reddish color. This color comes from iron dust on its surface. Mars has mountains, valleys, and large deserts that make it similar to Earth in some ways.

Mars has a thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, which makes the planet very cold and dry. Scientists believe that long ago, Mars may have had water on its surface, and this raises the possibility that life may have existed there in the past. Today, water can be found mostly as ice at the poles and underground.

Mars has two small moons called Phobos and Deimos. A day on Mars is very similar to a day on Earth, lasting about 24.6 hours, but a year on Mars is longer, taking about 687 Earth days. Because of its similarities to Earth, Mars is one of the main targets for future space exploration and possible human missions.</p></div>

<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the solar system. It has a rocky surface covered with many craters, cliffs, and wide plains created by meteor impacts over billions of years. Because Mercury has almost no atmosphere, it cannot trap heat, so temperatures change greatly between day and night. During the day, the surface becomes extremely hot, while at night it becomes freezing cold. One day on Mercury is very long compared to Earth, lasting about 59 Earth days, but one year is very short because the planet moves quickly around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury has no moons and no known life, but scientists study it to learn more about the early solar system and how rocky planets were formed. Although Mercury is a harsh and lifeless world, it remains an important and fascinating planet for space research.</p>

However, its environment is extremely different and very dangerous. Venus has a rocky surface with large volcanoes, high mountains, and wide plains made of solid lava from past eruptions. The planet is completely covered by thick clouds made of sulfuric acid, which reflect sunlight and make Venus very bright in the sky. Its atmosphere is made mostly of carbon dioxide and causes a powerful greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. A single day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus because it spins very slowly, while it completes one orbit around the Sun in about 225 Earth days. Venus has no moons and no known life, but scientists study it to understand climate change, planetary weather, and how atmospheres evolve over time.</p></div>

<p>Borjis is a fictional planet in deep space and is believed to be a world full of mystery and unknown life.
It is said to have many strange environments, including glowing plains, rocky mountains, dark oceans, and colorful skies. A large part of Borjis’s surface may be covered with unusual liquids that shine at night and affect the planet’s climate in special ways. Borjis’s atmosphere is imagined to contain rare gases that give the sky different colors and may allow strange life forms to breathe and survive.

The planet is thought to have one or more moons that influence its tides and weather patterns. Borjis is believed to rotate at a different speed from Earth, creating longer days and nights, and it orbits its star in a much longer time, forming a very long year. With its extreme conditions and hidden secrets, Borjis is considered a fascinating and mysterious world in its imaginary universe.</p>

It has a giant gaseous environment and does not have a solid surface like Earth, but is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has powerful winds, large storms, and thick clouds that move quickly through its atmosphere. The planet’s rings are made of ice, dust, and rock, and they shine brightly when light from the Sun reflects off them.

Saturn has many moons, some of which are very large and interesting, such as Titan and Enceladus, which may contain conditions suitable for life. Saturn rotates very fast, causing short days, and it takes many years to complete one orbit around the Sun, creating a long year. With its massive size and stunning rings, Saturn is one of the most fascinating planets in our solar system.</p></div>

<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its pale blue color.
It is an icy giant made mostly of gases and frozen materials such as methane, water, and ammonia, and it does not have a solid surface like Earth. The methane in its atmosphere gives Uranus its light blue appearance. Uranus has very cold temperatures, strong winds, and thick clouds that move through its upper atmosphere.

Uranus has many moons and a faint ring system similar to other giant planets. One unusual feature of Uranus is that it rotates on its side, which causes extreme and long seasons. A single day on Uranus is shorter than on Earth, but one year lasts much longer because of its great distance from the Sun. With its strange rotation and icy nature, Uranus is one of the most unique planets in the solar system.</p>
